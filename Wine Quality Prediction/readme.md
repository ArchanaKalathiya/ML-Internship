# Wine Quality Prediction Project

This repository contains code to predict the quality of wine based on various features using machine learning techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation. Three different classifiers are used: Logistic Regression, XGBoost Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC).

## Project Structure

- **winequality.csv**: Dataset file containing information about wine quality and its features.
- **wine_quality_prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, you need to install the following libraries:

- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computations in Python.
- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: A library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: A data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- **scikit-learn**: A machine learning library for various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms.
- **XGBoost**: A gradient boosting library for optimizing performance and predictive accuracy.
- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: A library for classification and regression tasks.

You can install these libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
