# House Price Prediction Project

Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! In this project, we explore and analyze a dataset containing various features related to houses. Our goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of houses based on these features.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required libraries using `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`.
2. Download the dataset from [HousePricePrediction.xlsx](link_to_your_dataset).
3. Run the code provided in `house_price_prediction.py`.
4. Check the exploratory data analysis, data processing, and the predictive model training steps.

## Key Features

- Data analysis and visualization with matplotlib and seaborn.
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and categorical variables.
- Utilization of OneHotEncoder for categorical feature encoding.
- Implementation of Linear Regression for price prediction.
- Model evaluation using mean absolute percentage error.

## Results

The predictive model demonstrates its ability to estimate house prices effectively. The exploratory data analysis provides insights into the dataset's characteristics, and the preprocessing ensures data quality before model training.
